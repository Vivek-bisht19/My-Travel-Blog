   <p> The Chota Char Dham (lit. 'the small four abodes/seats' or 'the small circuit of four abodes/seats') is an important modern Hindu pilgrimage circuit in Uttarakhand, in the Indian Himalayas. Located in the Garhwal region of the state of Uttarakhand, the circuit consists of four sitesâ€”Gangotri, Yamunotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath. Badrinath is also one of the four destinations (with each destination being in different corners of the country) of the longer Char Dham from which the Chota Char Dham likely draws its name
   </p>
   <p>Akshaya Tritiya (April or May in the Gregorian calendar) marks the beginning of the Chota Char Dham Yatra and closes two days after Diwali, on the day of Bhai-Bij (or Bhai Dooj) In May and June, tourists flock in large numbers, due to heavy rainfall greater chances of roadblocks or landslides in late July and August during monsoon season.
   </p>
   <p>The Annual Chota Char Dham Yatra resumed in May 2014, after being suspended during the 2013 Uttarakhand floods. The footfall has now improved due to proactive measures taken by the government of Uttarakhand. In 2022, in just two months (10 June-10 August), 2.8 million pilgrims have visited these Dhams.
   </p>
   <p>A record 4.1 million pilgrims visited Chota Char dham in 2022. Over 1.4 million pilgrims have already visited Kedarnath, over 600,000 have visited Gangotri, and over 500,000 have visited Yamunotri. Around 1.5 million pilgrims have already visited Badrinath the same year.</p>

 <li><h2>Yamunotri Dham</h2>

<p>It will probably begin from Barkot. You will drive up to the Yamunotri Dham which will be followed by a 7 km trek. Or you could also visit Uttarkashi, which is just about 100 km from the Gangotri Dham.
Yamuna, the second most sacred river in India, originates from Yamunotri. The Yamunotri temple is believed to be constructed by the king of Tehri, Naresh Sudarshan Shah in 1839. It is one of the pilgrimage sites you will see on this tour. The temple itself is a work of art, and the devotees make it more serene and beautiful. The Yamuna River looks breathtaking while flowing down from one side of the temple.

<p>Gangotri dham Located in the Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand, this is one of the four sites which make up the Chota Char Dham. The shrine is very special to the Hindus because of its incomparable beauty. Another key factor is that legends believe that this place is the origin of the river Ganga after it descended from heaven. The present shrine was built by Gorkha Commander, Amar Singh Thapa in the early 18th century. The river has always been considered the purest. People visit this place to attain Moksha.

<p>Kedarnath Temple From here, you can drive to Kedarnath, which is about 180 km from Uttarkashi, which will be followed by a 21 km trek uphill. In this ancient temple, we find inscriptions written in Pali. The present temple was built by Adi Shankaracharya Ji. On the inner walls of the temple, there are sculptures of various deities and scenes from mythology. On the outside of the temple, there is a large statue of the Nandi Bull. The temple is set amidst the mountains of the Garhwal Himalayas. The Kedarnath shrine is surrounded by breathtakingly beautiful snow-covered mountains. You will definitely feel at peace after visiting this place.
